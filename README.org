* Emacs config

+ It's a work in progress, like any other emacs config - mind you! :D

+ I'm also learning my way around elisp and creating elisp packages.

+ More than anything this is a good excercise/learning experience for me.

* [TODO]

+ Evaluate use of [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/SetupEl][setup.el]]
+ Install EMMS
