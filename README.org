* Personal emacs config

It's a work in progress, as any other configuration - mind you! :D
I'm also learning my way around elisp and creating packages.


* Inspired by...

[[https://www.spacemacs.org/][Spacemacs]] and [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][Doom Emacs]]

More than anything this is a good excercise/learning experience for me.

* Stuff TODO
  Couple of items I want to address, mostly ideas that I may/may not implement...

  + Better modularization
    + initialize layers based on a variable passed via command line... nah I don't know how useful this is... maybe not worth the time...?
  + Understand and fix my font configuration, big time.
  + Have a better org-mode experience
    + it's not bad but I've seen much much better... it's about time I fix mine.
  + Remove complexity, think I went a little overboard...
