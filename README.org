* Personal emacs config

It's a work in progress, as any other configuration - mind you! :D
I'm also learning my way around elisp and creating packages.

* Spacemacs inspired 

Spacemacs is a great project, it's actually how I started using emacs, evil mode FTW.
With time I learned more about the Emacs ecosystem, tried out a couple of configurations
and figured I like things in certain ways rather the others.

* TO DO
  There's a couple TODO items I need to address and I will keep track in here

** Better modularization
*** initialize layers based on a variable passed via command line
** Understand and fix my font configuration
** Have a better org-mode experience
