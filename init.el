;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up the essentials for incorporating my init org
;; file.  This is known as "literate programming", which I think is
;; particularly helpful for sharing Emacs configurations with a wider
;; audience that includes new or potential users (I am still very new
;; myself).
;;
;; See my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

;;; Code:

(require 'package)

(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
             '("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/"))

;; Make sure `use-package' is available.
(unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
  (package-refresh-contents)
  (package-install 'use-package))

;; Configure `use-package' prior to loading it.
(eval-and-compile
  (setq use-package-always-ensure nil)
  (setq use-package-always-defer nil)
  (setq use-package-always-demand nil)
  (setq use-package-expand-minimally nil)
  (setq use-package-enable-imenu-support t)
  (setq use-package-compute-statistics nil)
  ;; The following is VERY IMPORTANT.  Write hooks using their real name
  ;; instead of a shorter version: after-init ==> `after-init-hook'.
  ;;
  ;; This is to empower help commands with their contextual awareness,
  ;; such as `describe-symbol'.
  (setq use-package-hook-name-suffix nil))

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'use-package))

(use-package vc
  :config
  (setq vc-follow-symlinks t)) ; Because my dotfiles are managed that way

;; For my custom libraries
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/elisp/")

;; I create an "el" version of my Org configuration file as a final step
;; before closing down Emacs.  This is done to load the latest version
;; of my code upon startup.
;;
;; Also helps with initialisation times.  Not that I care too much about
;; thoseâ€¦ Hence why I no longer bother with deferring package loading
;; either by default or on a case-by-case basis.
(let* ((conf "~/.emacs.d/emacs-init")
